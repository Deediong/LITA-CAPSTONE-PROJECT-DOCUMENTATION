   - Checked datatype: Checked the column headers for inconsistent or wrong datatype
   - Created measure: Created measure for the order date in the sales data to know the average sales year Average Sales Year -    *AVERAGE(SalesData[OrderDate].[Year])*

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After cleaning the data in Excel, it was exported to SQL for analysis, then it was exported to Power BI for dashboard creation. In Excel, the following steps were carried out:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated basic statistics and analyzed distributions.

Visualization: Created charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns.

Dashboard Creation: Developed interactive dashboards to present key findings effectively.
